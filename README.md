- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndyKR6DD
- 👀 I’m interested in amateur (HAM) radio SW development personally, and I am looking for related projects in place or
-  under development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more to expand my very limited Linux knowledge. My favorite laguage is Forth, currently
- Win32Forth under Windows 10, and Gforth on an RPi3B on which I am continuing development of a radio direction finding
- (RDF) package for an RDF network of nodes installed at high elevations of participating San Francisco (SF) Bay area hams.
- If ncessary, I may learn more about Python, which is what my ham radio web smart guru radio hams are using for acquiring,
- sending over TCP/IP, storing, manipulating, data pertaining to bearings on signals and plotting probable locations of
- transmitting stations. 
- 💞️ I am collaborating on the github project formed by Robin KN5R recently launched, which initially collects bearings data
- from my RPi3B connected to a radio receiver in my ham radio shack: rdf.kn5r.net but when other RDF nodes are added there will
- be simultaneously vectors crossing from their locations.
- 📫 How to reach me ... kr6dd@yahoo.com or kr6dd@arrl.net which is a reflector to forth.fanatic@gmai;.com .
